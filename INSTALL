Here is a brief guide on how to build QRESTServer

1 - Unpack:  This should give a top-level directory with the subdirectories
    listed in README, as well as a few documentation files and a buildAndTest
    script.

2- Update dependencies:
    * git submodule update --init --recursive

3 - Requirements:
    * Linux x86 64bit machine
    * g++: v7.3 or above
    * GNU make: v4.0 or above
    * Following Qt development packages version 5.6 or above:
            - Qt5Core
            - Qt5Concurrent
            - Qt5Network
            - Qt5JSON
            - Qt5Test

    * Following Qt development packages are optional and activated if existent
            - Qt5WebSocket

    * Following projects are needed and defined as submodules
            - TargomanCommon (https://github.com/Targoman/TargomanCommon.git)
            - QHttp (https://github.com/Targoman/QHttp.git)
            - multipart-parser (https://github.com/FooBarWidget/multipart-parser.git)
    * hiredis library is also needed for compiling the library
            - run `apt install libhiredis-dev` in ubuntu to install this dependency

4 - run qmake with following options:
    * CONFIG+=debug if you want to build a debugging version
    * PREFIX=DESIRED_LOCATION if you want to install binaries in a folder other than default paths

5 - All outputs will be stored in 'out' directory at top level. subdirectories will be:
    * bin:      application and submodule oututs (if any).
    * build:    Build process object files
    * conf:     Dictionaries and static configurations off all apps and tools
    * include:  APIs and essential include files for further development
    * lib:      Shared objects, dlls and static libraries from base library and its submodules
    * unitTest  UnitTest binaries
    * test      Examples and test outputs
    * .depsBuilt Empty file created once upon submodules are prepared
